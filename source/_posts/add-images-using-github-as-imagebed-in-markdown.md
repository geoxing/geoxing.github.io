In the post [How to develop commercial production](http://geoxing.github.io/2015/12/08/How-to-develop-commercial-production/)  
I get a problemï¼Œlike the expression shown: 
```

#### multi-projects, one build for mid business  
Module num > 20  
develop num > 100

- develop process diagram:
commit role: from dev to bundle
commit way: from committing code  to repositories

integration phase  
release phase

```
and,after it is be  generated, deployed, and tested , all the images gone.  
finally, I figure out the imagebed must be used, and github may be available  
so, the steps is:  
1. create a repositories named photos on github
2. make dir named photos
3. git bash on dir
4. add images into the github
```
git init
git add *.png,*.jpg
git commit -m "add some markdown photos"
git remote add origin https://github.com/geoxing/photos.git
git push -u origin master
```
5. replace the local path by  the raw path of image on the github
6. enjoy!
