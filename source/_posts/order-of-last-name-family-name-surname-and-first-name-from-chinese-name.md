In china, the last name/family name/surname is placed before  a person's given name/first name, for example, Wang Ming and Zhang sifeng,  
but if you send email  or introduce youself on your business card, what kind of order is more formal?  
In my opinion: 
# Surname must be upper-case
```
WANG
CAI
XING
```
# The given name's first character must be capital
```
Ming
Sifeng
```
# So, I recommend this format should be better: first name+,+space+last name
```
Ming, WANG
Sifeng, ZHANG
Huifeng, XING
Weiwei, CAI
```
