This answer  come from [Paul Denlinger](https://www.quora.com/profile/Paul-Denlinger) ,ref [link](https://www.quora.com/How-does-China%E2%80%99s-family-oriented-culture-impact-the-role-of-women-in-Chinese-society),  
He made sense, so I decide to  thanslate it to chinese, enjoy it.
>Women have always played leading roles in managing Chinese families, especially when it comes to budget and children' education.
You can learn something just from the language: the traditional polite term for wife used by men/husbands in traditional times was 内人 which can be translated into "domestic or inside" person. 
Many Europeans and Americans assumed that this just meant that the wife was the domestic person.
What the Chinese didn't tell the Europeans and Americans was that the "domestic person" had control over all household finances, and that Chinese had handed over this responsibility to women many generations ago.
It was white European and American women who had no power over family finances, or even their own finances!
When dealing with outside (non-family) members, the women were expected to show proper deference and respect to the men of the household for their opinions, and not steal the limelight, or show them up anyway.
But these were just social rules. The men knew what was going on.  

女人一直在管理家庭食物方面扮演者重要角色，尤其是在家庭预算和孩子教育方面。  
你可以从语言中获得一些信息：在古代，男人或丈夫礼貌的称呼妻子是“内人”， 可以被翻译成“家里人或里面的人”，许多欧美人认为这意味着  
妻子是本国人。  
中国人没有告诉欧美人的是：“内人”控制着所有的家庭财务，前几代中国人就已经把财务权交给了女人。  
而欧美女人并没有家庭的财务权，甚至是自己的财务权！  
当与家庭外的人打交道时， 女人被要求显示的温顺，尊重丈夫作为一家之主的意见，不会被夺取光芒。  
但这些是社会规则，男人们知道其中的道理。

and，the George Chen's answer seem to be interesting：

>China is fast changing in every aspect; I might be a little out of touch.
From my experience, professional women can form vast social networks, and their seemingly powerful husbands are just dumb puppets. This is nepotism in its naked form. All is well if you are a man growing up in such an environment — you'll be doted and pampered and indulged — until one day you fall in love with someone they don't like. All of sudden you become an outsider; you lose all your connections over night. Communicating with them on such matters is like talking to a solid stonewall; not a single one of them shares your sympathy, and those insensitive remarks behind your girlfriend's back hurt you like hell — this is probably the first time a certain man feels pain on a woman's behalf.  Believe it or not, similar to some men thinking woman's virginity is something praiseworthy, these powerful women are not troubled at all if their young male off-springs live a life of celibacy even in their 20s. The bottom line is, you are free, but you are on your own now; I guess it's about time to be a man, or someone else's puppet.  

中国各个方面都在快速的变化；我可能有一点体会：
从我的经历来看，职业女性形成了巨大的社会网络，他们貌似强大的丈夫仅仅是不会说话的木偶。这是一种赤裸裸的裙带关系。  
如果一个男人在一个被宠的环境中长大，一切都是美好的，直到他与一个大家都不喜欢的女孩相爱。  
突然你变成了局外人，一夜之间你失去了所有的联系。与他们交流似乎是对牛弹琴。没有人同情你。女朋友背后坏话评论让你犹如地狱。  
这可能是一个男人第一次在女人问题上感到痛苦。信不信由你，类似的问题是一些男人认为处女是值得称赞的，但是有权利的女人并不为此烦恼，  
如果他们的男性孩子在20岁就选择独身。底线就是，你是自由的，但你是在自己的地盘上。我猜是到了选择做一个男人还是一个木偶的时刻了。
