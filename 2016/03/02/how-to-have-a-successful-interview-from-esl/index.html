        <p>This <strong>series</strong> is design to teach you the english you need to know to have successful interview.   </p>
<a id="more"></a> 
<p>The questions from the series are the most common questions as us&#x2019;s bussiness interviews. Each <strong>episode</strong> have two parts,<br>First, we give you some important tips and how to answer the interview question, Second, we <strong>provide</strong> you with two smaple answers<br>that <strong>useless</strong> tips and answering the question. you might <strong>hear</strong>  a typically bussiness interview.<br>you will hear each  sample answer read slowly,then you  hear  explaination of  the <strong>Vocabulary</strong> and expression we used in<br>the answer. Finally you  hear the answer read at the normal speed. All the episode come with learning guid that contain all of<br>tips  we discussed, <strong>definition</strong> and sample sentences for each vocabulary word we used and a complete transcript of the episodes.<br>let&#x2019;s begin with question no 1, tell me about your self?<br>tell me about your self? is usually first question that you will hear at bussiness interview. your goal in answering question is <strong>prove</strong><br>your interviewer and show the interviewer that you have the skill and experiences to be the <strong>ideal</strong> or perfect <strong>candidate</strong> for the job.<br>Here is some tips in answering  the question, keep your answer short at  about  2  minutes, the person interviewing in you want you give them<br>an overview and generalized idea of your skill and qualificaiotn. you don&#x2019;t want to talk to much at first question. 2 or 3 minutes it&#x2019;s<br><strong>all</strong> you or really need. Since you can expect this question will be asked in the interview, you should prepare somthing that you can tell the person<br>the <strong>general qualification</strong> that you have in the short amount of time.<br>A second tip is focus on work related skill or accomplishment, not personal infomation. When the interviews ask you to tell him or her your self,<br>their intresting ing thing are related to the job, you may have personal accomplishment or personal infomation,<br>but  what you are wanted to mostly hear is why you are good person for this job, so don&#x2019;t talk about your family, or a good <strong>vacation  you<br>went on</strong>, or something that you have <strong>done</strong>  that not relate to the job in someway.<br>a <strong>third</strong> tip is  tell the interviewer  why you think  your related work skill or accomplishment would be <strong>asset</strong> to the company. The asset<br>is a positive contribution to the company, you want tell the person interviewing in you, not was just what your skill  are the thing you can do, and the<br>thing you have done, your accommplishment, you also want tell them  why they are related, important for the company,and why you would be able to<br>give somthing to the company it does&#x2019;t have right now, because of your  skill and accomplishment.<br>Fourth, you want describe your education and work history very briefly. Normally if you are gonging on a interview,you would talk about very briefly<br>what your study in the college, for example, what degree do you have? do you have bachelor degrees, master degree, or <strong>PHD or doctor</strong> ? you want<br>tell them where you went to school or what you studied scool? then, you want say a little about what the company you work with or work for? what position<br>you  have had in that company? so you give them some infomation, so that they know in gerenal what you been in doing before you came to the <strong>scene view</strong>.<br>you don&#x2019;t want normally talk about high school or grade school, most employeer  are not interested in that, unless you only graducated from high school,<br>you have&#x2019;t gone  college yet,then you might menmtion your high school degree, your high school <strong>diploma</strong>.<br>Since you want to tell the interviewer about things you have done and jobs you have had that are related to the position that you are interviewing for,<br>you want tell them about your skill and accomplishment, but you are also tell the interviewer or intterviewers about specific things you have done, specific<br>job you have had, that a somehow related to your positions you are  interviews for now.<br>Finally, you want mentions one, may be two, personal <strong>characteristics</strong> that will  help you <strong>accomplish</strong> your goal, and give a short example to <strong>illusrate</strong>,<br>we said early you don&#x2019;t want talk about personal life in this question,but person characteristics are little different, person characteristics are thing that you have<br>and are related to the job, things such as being able to <strong>get job down at time</strong>, focusing and concentrating you attention on  the job, you maight say you have<br>good attention to  detail, you can look at out the little things in the issue and project, make sure and take care of them, that was personal characteristics.<br>then, you can give them example why they are important in the job or things you have already done, you may say I have a project where I had many different parts that<br>i have to take care of it, as i was able to do  them all. that way you showing the person, your telling the interviewer how your personal characteristics will be able to<br>help you do your job better, and interview in general <strong>particularly</strong> for us bussiness is sort of like a <strong>opportunity</strong> to  sell your self, you have to able to<br>show to the person and you are the best man to the job.<br>To summary then, in answering the question, you want keep the answer short to the three minutes, you want focus on work-related skills and accomplishment, not your personal<br>infomation, you want tell the interviews why your work-related skills and accomplishment would be  positive thing to the company, you want to talk about your education<br>and where you work before you came to the interview, you also want tell the interviews the kinds of job you have done, and how they relate to the position your<br>interview for. finally, you can mentions some personal characteristics that would be important in doing the job your interviewing for.<br>Now let&#x2019;s listen to the first sample answer.  </p>
