<p>How To Be Effective<br>February 2012 (Ph.D. student)</p>
<p>Summary<br>As I approach the end of my Ph.D. career, I’m reflecting on how I was able to get more and better work done than many of my peers without stressing nearly as much. I made it through K-12, college, and a Ph.D. program while losing very little sleep. </p>
<p>Here are some habits that have made me more effective than people who are often smarter than I am. In the long run, good work habits – consistently applied over time – are far more important than so-called “natural intelligence” or “aptitude”.</p>

        <p>最近，美帝爆发了一件官告民的事件 -“FBI控告Apple”，引起了轩然大波。</p>
<ol>
<li>事件起因：在美帝一个小镇去年发生了一件恐怖袭击，美国FBI获取了恐怖分子的一部Apple 5C的手机，但是由于手机设有开机密码，无法打开，想请Apple开一个后门，解开密码。经过两个月的谈判，Apple坚持不开，于是<br>   FBI将Apple告上法庭。<br>  厨子写了一封至顾客的一封信，发在了Apple网站上，认为如果开了这个先例，那么“公权力”以后就可以堂而皇之的查看用户隐私，以及要求其他科技公司也这么做，最终损害的应该是整个社会。<br>  FBI指着APPLE是为了市场营销。<br>  川普为了大选，呼吁大家抵制苹果。<br>  民调显示51%支持打开手机。</li>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers. We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand. </p>
<p>This moment calls for public discussion, and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake.</p>
<p>Answers to your questions about privacy and security</p>
<p>The Need for Encryption<br>Smartphones, led by iPhone, have become an essential part of our lives. People use them to store an incredible amount of personal information, from our private conversations to our photos, our music, our notes, our calendars and contacts, our financial information and health data, even where we have been and where we are going.</p>
<p>All that information needs to be protected from hackers and criminals who want to access it, steal it, and use it without our knowledge or permission. Customers expect Apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information, and at Apple we are deeply committed to safeguarding their data.</p>
<p>Compromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk. That is why encryption has become so important to all of us.</p>
<p>For many years, we have used encryption to protect our customers&#x2019; personal data because we believe it&#x2019;s the only way to keep their information safe. We have even put that data out of our own reach, because we believe the contents of your iPhone are none of our business.</p>
<p>The San Bernardino Case<br>We were shocked and outraged by the deadly act of terrorism in San Bernardino last December. We mourn the loss of life and want justice for all those whose lives were affected. The FBI asked us for help in the days following the attack, and we have worked hard to support the government&#x2019;s efforts to solve this horrible crime. We have no sympathy for terrorists.</p>
<p>When the FBI has requested data that&#x2019;s in our possession, we have provided it. Apple complies with valid subpoenas and search warrants, as we have in the San Bernardino case. We have also made Apple engineers available to advise the FBI, and we&#x2019;ve offered our best ideas on a number of investigative options at their disposal.</p>
<p>We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.</p>
<p>Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software &#x2014; which does not exist today &#x2014; would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone&#x2019;s physical possession.</p>
<p>The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.</p>
<p>The Threat to Data Security<br>Some would argue that building a backdoor for just one iPhone is a simple, clean-cut solution. But it ignores both the basics of digital security and the significance of what the government is demanding in this case.</p>
<p>In today&#x2019;s digital world, the &#x201C;key&#x201D; to an encrypted system is a piece of information that unlocks the data, and it is only as secure as the protections around it. Once the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge.</p>
<p>The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that&#x2019;s simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks &#x2014; from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable.</p>
<p>The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers &#x2014; including tens of millions of American citizens &#x2014; from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe.</p>
<p>We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. For years, cryptologists and national security experts have been warning against weakening encryption. Doing so would hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on companies like Apple to protect their data. Criminals and bad actors will still encrypt, using tools that are readily available to them.</p>
<p>A Dangerous Precedent<br>Rather than asking for legislative action through Congress, the FBI is proposing an unprecedented use of the All Writs Act of 1789 to justify an expansion of its authority.</p>
<p>The government would have us remove security features and add new capabilities to the operating system, allowing a passcode to be input electronically. This would make it easier to unlock an iPhone by &#x201C;brute force,&#x201D; trying thousands or millions of combinations with the speed of a modern computer.</p>
<p>The implications of the government&#x2019;s demands are chilling. If the government can use the All Writs Act to make it easier to unlock your iPhone, it would have the power to reach into anyone&#x2019;s device to capture their data. The government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone&#x2019;s microphone or camera without your knowledge.</p>
<p>Opposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>We are challenging the FBI&#x2019;s demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country. We believe it would be in the best interest of everyone to step back and consider the implications.</p>
<p>While we believe the FBI&#x2019;s intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Women have always played leading roles in managing Chinese families, especially when it comes to budget and children’ education.<br>You can learn something just from the language: the traditional polite term for wife used by men/husbands in traditional times was 内人 which can be translated into “domestic or inside” person.<br>Many Europeans and Americans assumed that this just meant that the wife was the domestic person.<br>What the Chinese didn’t tell the Europeans and Americans was that the “domestic person” had control over all household finances, and that Chinese had handed over this responsibility to women many generations ago.<br>It was white European and American women who had no power over family finances, or even their own finances!<br>When dealing with outside (non-family) members, the women were expected to show proper deference and respect to the men of the household for their opinions, and not steal the limelight, or show them up anyway.<br>But these were just social rules. The men knew what was going on.  </p>

        <p>Today, I heard one episode podcast named <a href="http://ipn.li/itgonglun/187/">ITgonglun 187</a>, they mentioned<br>a article <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/cover_story/2016/01/how_facebook_s_news_feed_algorithm_works.html">Who Controls Your Facebook Feed</a><br>about Facebook’s NewsFeed,it sounds interesting，So i translated  it into Chinese.<br> 背景：Facebook’s NewsFeed:相当于wechat（微信）的朋友圈 + 公众号，由于Facebook没有公众号的限制（一天只能发一条），所有的事件都放在<br> timeline里，试想一下，一个用户有几十个好友，再+几十个公众号（各种新闻媒体），被刷屏的几率很大，怎么保证最佳的用户体验是Facebook要考虑的问题？<br> 而事实上，这正是Facebook的看家本领，他是如何做到的呢？</p>
